An Upwork client gave me a job to unfriend his facebook friend . He also gave me a list of friends to unfriend them . But manual process is too much boooring . 

I am a python script writer so then I developed a script and now I am sharing that with you . 

In this facebook_unfriend.py files there are many important things about the selenium .
IN that script the selenium will unfriend the targeted friend which is given into the excel sheet . 
Remember to mention the Excel file name . 
In the user variable just give the USER name of the PC and it will run Default chrome profile where the targeted FB will be logged in already
Each time when you run this file in the terminal it will ask you from which row you have to start where to stop. 
Just Install python , Selenium, Padas and openpyxl and you are ready to go .
